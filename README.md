# iris-tools
Old class structure for working with IRIS FUV data. This was created as a way to work with IRIS level-3 files, adapted from a series of functions that grew out of my dissatisfaction with available spectral fitting codes.

As it stands, this was never fully developed, and would need some work to stand on its own as a usable package. It was last edited in March '22, when my coding practices weren't... as good. Still, between the HSGpy and firs-tools packages, I may eventually come back to this and develop it to an actual package.
